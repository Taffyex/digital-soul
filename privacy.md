# Privacy Policy for Digital Soul

**Last Updated:** January 1st 2026

## 1. Introduction
Digital Soul ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how our application processes data from third-party services (Spotify, Pinterest, Trakt).

## 2. Data We Collect
We do not store your login credentials. Authentication is handled via secure OAuth 2.0 protocols directly with the providers.

We access the following data solely for the purpose of "Soul Synthesis":
* **Spotify:** Top Artists and Tracks.
* **Trakt:** Movie search history and watchlist.
* **Pinterest:** Public board titles and pin descriptions.

## 3. How We Use Your Data
The data fetched is sent to our local processing engine and a third-party AI service (Google Gemini) to generate:
* Aesthetic Keywords (e.g., "Neon", "Concrete").
* Vector Embeddings for clustering.

**We do not sell your data.** The "Soul Profile" is stored locally on your device and in your private Firestore document.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Our app's core functionality requires interaction with:
* **Pinterest API:** To fetch visual texture data.
* **Google Gemini API:** For text processing.

## 5. Data Deletion
You may delete your "Soul" at any time within the app settings, which removes all associated data from our database. To revoke access to your external accounts, please use the security settings page of the respective provider (e.g., Pinterest Apps).
